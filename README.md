This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

To Setup:

Get a YouTube API key and make it available to the rest of your application from a new file, src/config/youtube.js following the example file.

Run:

npm install

live-server

To test run:

npm test

To see the actual tests, click debug.
